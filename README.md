## ðŸ“˜ Introduction
This project aims to improve cellular reception on the 1st and 2nd floors of a building following multiple reports of poor signal quality. The work includes surveying signal strength, mapping weak zones, and designing/installing a booster system with strategically placed antennas to ensure reliable coverage.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives 

- Survey and map cellular signal strength on targeted floors 
- Design an antenna and booster layout to enhance coverage 
- Install external and internal antennas with signal boosters 
- Test and tune the system for optimal performance 

## ðŸš€ Skills Learned

- Project Planning & Execution â€“ Defined objectives, created step-by-step implementation plan, and followed through.
- System Design â€“ Ability to translate survey data into a working technical layout for coverage improvement.
- Procurement & Budget Coordination â€“ Requested vendor quotes, submitted purchase orders, coordinated deliveries
- Installation Oversight â€“ Managed on-site work, ensured compliance with spacing/length rules, oversaw quality control.
- Survey & Assessment â€“ Conducted on-site performance evaluations to establish a baseline and guide design.
- Testing & Continuous Improvement â€“ Measured performance, iterated antenna placement, fine-tuned equipment.

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used

- Layout & Diagram Tools: Microsoft Visio and Lucidchart.
- Project Tracking Tools: Jira
- Documentation Systems: SharePoint (Microsoft)
- Signal Scanner: Wilson Pro Cellular Network Scanner 5G

## ðŸ§ª Project Walkthrough

âœ… Step 1: Signal Survey
- Conducted comprehensive signal strength scans across targeted floors using the weBoost Signal Scanner.

- Mapped weak zones and dead spots in Microsoft Visio to visualize coverage gaps.

- Applied Survey & Assessment skills to establish a reliable performance baseline.

âœ… Step 2: Design System
- Translated survey findings into a detailed antenna and booster layout using Lucidchart.

- Selected optimal equipment based on technical data and compliance requirements.

- Planned coaxial cable routing within â‰¤100 ft and ensured antenna spacing â‰¥80 ft to prevent signal overlap.

- Demonstrated System Design and Project Planning & Execution expertise.

âœ… Step 3: Procurement
- Gathered vendor quotes for both hardware and installation services.

- Managed budget coordination by submitting purchase orders and obtaining approvals through corporate channels.

- Coordinated delivery schedules with vendors to align with installation timelines.

- Applied Procurement & Budget Coordination skills in alignment with project deadlines.

âœ… Step 4: Installation
- Oversaw the installation of directional rooftop antennas and internal dome antennas.

- Ensured signal boosters were connected and coaxial cabling was run without extensions to maintain performance integrity.

- Managed vendor teams on-site, ensuring compliance with technical standards and corporate safety guidelines.

- Demonstrated Installation Oversight and cross-team coordination.

âœ… Step 5: Testing & Optimization
- Used weBoost Signal Scanner to verify performance improvements in previously weak areas.

- Adjusted booster gain levels and antenna placement for optimal coverage.

- Documented final configurations and results in SharePoint for reference and future maintenance.

- Showcased Testing & Continuous Improvement skills with measurable results.
