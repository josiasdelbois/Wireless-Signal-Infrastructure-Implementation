## ðŸ“˜ Introduction
This project aims to improve cellular reception on the 1st and 2nd floors of a building following multiple reports of poor signal quality. The work includes surveying signal strength, mapping weak zones, and designing/installing a booster system with strategically placed antennas to ensure reliable coverage.

> [!NOTE]
> This repository references an operational project for an active company. To protect security, ensure privacy, and limit liability, floor maps and signal survey data have been excluded or Obfuscated.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives 

- Survey and map cellular signal strength on targeted floors 
- Design an antenna and booster layout to enhance coverage 
- Install external and internal antennas with signal boosters 
- Test and tune the system for optimal performance 

## ðŸš€ Skills Learned

- Project Planning & Execution â€“ Defined objectives, created step-by-step implementation plan, and followed through.
- System Design â€“ Ability to translate survey data into a working technical layout for coverage improvement.
- Procurement & Budget Coordination â€“ Requested vendor quotes, submitted purchase orders, coordinated deliveries
- Installation Oversight â€“ Managed on-site work, ensured compliance with spacing/length rules, oversaw quality control.
- Survey & Assessment â€“ Conducted on-site performance evaluations to establish a baseline and guide design.
- Testing & Continuous Improvement â€“ Measured performance, iterated antenna placement, fine-tuned equipment.

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used

- Layout & Diagram Tools: Microsoft Visio and Lucidchart.
- Project Tracking Tools: Jira
- Documentation Systems: SharePoint (Microsoft)
- Signal Scanner: Wilson Pro Cellular Network Scanner 5G

## ðŸ§ª Project Walkthrough

âœ… Step 1: Signal Survey
- Scanned signal strength using weBoost Signal Scanner.

- Mapped weak zones in Visio to visualize coverage gaps.

- Established baseline using Survey & Assessment skills.

âœ… Step 2: System Design
- Created antenna and booster layout in Lucidchart.

- Selected equipment based on specs and compliance.

- Planned cable routing and antenna spacing to avoid overlap.

âœ… Step 3: Procurement
- Collected vendor quotes and managed purchase approvals.

- Scheduled deliveries to align with installation timelines.

âœ… Step 4: Installation
- Oversaw antenna and booster setup with vendor teams.

- Ensured cabling met performance and safety standards.

âœ… Step 5: Testing & Optimization
- Verified improvements with signal scanner.

- Tuned gain levels and antenna placement.

- Documented final setup in SharePoint.
